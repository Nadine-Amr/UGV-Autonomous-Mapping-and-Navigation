# UGV-Autonomous-Mapping-and-Navigation

The Robotics Operating System platform (ROS) was used to drive a TurtleBot to autonomously map a previously unknown terrain, localize itself after building the full map, and eventually autonomously navigate to desired locations while avoiding obstacles and choosing the shortest path. This was part of the tasks required for the Mohammed Bin Zayed International Robotics Competition (MBZIRC) scheduled in 2019.
